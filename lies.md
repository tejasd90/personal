- "Your emotions"
- Phone as a formality
- Selectively complaining me about your informer
- Not helping, humanity
- Why suddenly "raag majhyavar nighala" wihout any warning? always on earning days
- Poisoning I's ears and minds
- "Jaavai mhanun kahi kartavya nahi nibhavala"
- No one tried to resolve feud between M and A. Now "ARE" trying to break the relation
- Aadvik did not wish this year
- Sold self respect with me
- 80% times fights when your parents came(lie, its 10%) vs 80-90% times when my parents came
- Bangles
- "Photo kadhun takato hech dhande karto". Tuza bhau kaai karto mag?
- "Avani chi favourite taai Iru taai"
- Continuously "Aajobanchi naat"
- "Oven", "To faaltu manus aahe"
- Behave differently for own brother vs own husband so much.
- You also recorded my mother and Ira, didn't you? I didn't get paranoid then.
- You don't deserve me. When I was depressed, alone and in house, you were out partying, kittying. You didn't think once about me.
- Height of wannabeism with the song "Country Roads take me home". Never once appreciated my taste in music, never wanted to find out my taste in music, we heard a musician play it at Mauritius, I have played it multiple times, then all of a sudden want that song for status. You live just for status.
- Whats the point of writing me "Saari zindagi mi tula japnaar aahe", and then kicking me multiple times in 2022?
- You can tell all the things you want about your childhood, but if I tell/show anything, about say my school, then you don't like that. Shame on you.
- He can stick "I is A's favourite taai", but I can't even tell a word about her uncle/cousin to her. Shame on you.
